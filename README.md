# Moral-Models-Moral-Behavior
Does moral culture contribute to the evolution of cooperation? Here, we examine individuals' and
communities' models of what it means to be good and bad and how they correspond to corollary
behavior across a variety of socioecological contexts. Our sample includes over 600 people from
eight dierent eld sites that include foragers, horticulturalists, herders, and the fully marketreliant.
We rst examine the universals and particulars of explicit moral models. We then use
these moral models to assess their role in the outcome of an economic experiment designed to
detect systematic, dishonest rule-breaking favoritism. We show that individuals are slightly more
inclined to play by the rules when their moral models include the task-relevant virtues of \honesty"
and \dishonesty." We also nd that religious beliefs are better predictors of honest play than
these virtues. The predictive power of these values' and beliefs' local prevalence, however, remains
inconclusive. In summary, we nd that religious beliefs and moral models may help promote honest
behavior that may widen the breadth of human cooperation.
